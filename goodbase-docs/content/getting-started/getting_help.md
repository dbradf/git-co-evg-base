You can get a list of all the available options with the `--help` option. 

{{< hint warning >}}
**Note**\ 
When using the `--help` option, you will need to call the command directly via `git-co-evg-base`
and not execute it via `git` (i.e. `git co-evg-base`, note the space after `git`). This is due to 
a limitation in the git help system.
{{< /hint >}}

Additionally, there is a `--verbose` option that can be specified to get more detailed information 
about what the command is doing.
